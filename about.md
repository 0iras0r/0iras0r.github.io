I'm an IT engineering student from Italy.

I run Arch Linux on my laptop Samsung RF511 S02IT, I use xterm console, and bash. My
window manager is the awesome Ratpoison, simply the best.

I love everything about Free Software, but I can't use only free programs at the moment, I'm
working on that. Now my motto is:<<If there is a chance to use free software, use it,
otherwise install the essential of "evil software", and wait for better times.>>
