{% highlight c %}
#My first program in C language

int main(void){

printf("Hello World")

return 0;

I'm totally disappointed with the media that talks only about rich developers only to sponsor 
them and their products, avoid to spend two words about a great man who change computer 
history, and the way we develop programs. It was Dennis Ritchie, chapeau!
